# Task 0: Iris Prediction

Train an estimator that predicts the type of Iris for the flowers given in this dataset.

## Description

The Iris flower dataset is one of the most famous datasets in the field of machine learning. It contains measurements of four features (sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width) for 150 iris flowers, categorized into three species: setosa, versicolor, and virginica.

Participants in this competition are tasked with building a machine learning model to accurately classify the species of iris flowers based on the provided features. This is an excellent opportunity to practice and demonstrate your skills in data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation.

### Dataset details

The dataset consists of 150 samples, each with four features:

- Sepal length in cm
- Sepal width in cm
- Petal length in cm
- Petal width in cm

The target variable is the species of the iris, which can be one of the following:

- Setosa
- Versicolor
- Virginica

### Objective

The goal of this competition is to train a model that can predict the species of iris flowers based on their features. Participants will be provided with a training set (train.csv) containing the features and species for a subset of the flowers. The remaining flowers' features will be provided in a test set (test.csv), and participants will need to predict their species.

## Evaluation

Submissions are evaluated based on the accuracy of the predictions. Your submission should contain the predicted species for each flower in the test set.
