# Outlier Detection

Here, we designed a pipeline to systematically evaluate and optimize outlier detection methods, combined with imputation and standardization strategies, on the given training dataset. The primary goal is to identify the most effective configuration for isolating anomalies in data.

## **Data Preprocessing**:

- **Imputation**: Missing values in the dataset are handled using one of several imputation techniques: `mean`, `median`, `knn`, and `most_frequent`.
- **Standardization**: Imputed data is then scaled with a variety of techniques (`standard`, `robust`, `quantile` or None), which is crucial for stabilizing the data distribution and enhancing the effectiveness of outlier detection.

So in total, there are 16 different combinations of imputation and scaling methods, which are evaluated in the pipeline. The plots `plots/impute_scale_pca.pdf` and `plots/impute_scale_tsne.pdf` visualize the impact of each imputation and scaling method on the data distribution, using PCA and t-SNE transformations, respectively.

## **Outlier Detection**:

Three primary detection algorithms (`OneClassSVM`, `IsolationForest`, `LocalOutlierFactor`) are applied to each combination of imputation and scaling. The techniques are applied on the PCA-transformed (reduced to 2 components) dataset. We visualize the outliers and the decision boundary of each method in the plots `plots/impute_scale_pca_outliers_IsolationForest.pdf`, `plots/impute_scale_pca_outliers_LocalOutlierFactor.pdf`, and `plots/impute_scale_pca_outliers_OneClassSVM.pdf`.

The best performing method is `IsolationForest`:

## **Evaluation**:

In order to compare how well the outlier detection method worked, we compared the processed training distribution to the test distribution. We calculated the mean, variance, skewness, and kurtosis of the training and test data, with and without outliers.

The pipelineâ€™s evaluation results demonstrate that the best-performing setup utilizes `most_frequent` imputation, `quantile` scaling, and `IsolationForest` detection, as seen in the PCA visualization (`best_method.pdf`). Nearly as good is the `most_frequent` imputation, `quantile` scaling, and `OneClassSVM` detection.
