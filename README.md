# Advanced-ML-Projects

Coding assignments of the "Advanced Machine Learning" course at ETH ZÃ¼rich (Fall 2024).

## Project 0: Iris Prediction

Dummy task to get familiar with the platform. The goal is to train an estimator that predicts the type of Iris for the flowers given in the dataset.

## Project 1: Predicting age from brain MRI features

This project involves predicting a person's age from MRI brain image data using machine learning techniques. The workflow includes filling missing values, detecting and handling outliers, selecting relevant features, and applying regression models to predict age based on processed brain features.
